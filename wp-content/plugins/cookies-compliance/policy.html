  <p>Hello there. Thank you for registering your interest in our new Cookies Policy. We believe in letting you know what's going on behind the scenes when you visit our website – and have some Cookie news for you.</p>
  <p>When you visit our site, we install a selection of Cookies on your computer, and as we believe you have a right to know, we'd like to make aware of this. The Cookies are simple text files, and don't save any identifiable personal data about you on your computer. They are a way for us to recognise if you've visited our website before, which provides us with Analytics data from Google about our website traffic levels, and improve user experience.</p>
  <p>Variety is the spice of life, which is why there is more than one type of Cookie and we thought we'd explain what this means for you, the user.</p>
  <p><span class="policy-highlight">Strictly Necessary Cookies are installed automatically as you wouldn't be able to use the internet without them.</span> They can't gather information that could be used for marketing purposes. They are used for navigational purposes, and store your preferences. For example, these Cookies are placed on your computer when you choose to reduce a drop down menu, and then navigate to a another page on the website. The drop down menu showing on the new page, will remain reduced.</p>
  <p><span class="policy-highlight">Performance Cookies only collect information about how you've used our website</span>, for our benefit. For example, this includes Analytics – where the data we collect enables us to better manage the overall performance and design of our site.</p>
  <p>Should you choose to view a video on our site, you are consenting to the third-party Cookie policy from YouTube.</p>
  <p>Thank you for taking the time to read about our new Cookies Policy. At Jennifer Newman Studio, we're dedicated to bringing you the best possible web experience, in an honest and transparent way.</p>
  <p>Thank you,<br />
